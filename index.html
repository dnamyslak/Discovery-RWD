                <h1>Parker Schnabel</h1>
                <h2>Hailing from Haines, Alaska, Parker has grown up with gold fever. Ever since he can remember, Parker's beloved grandpa, John Schnabel, ran the family gold mine, Big Nugget. Since Parker's feet could reach the pedals, he's been operating heavy machinery and learning the trade.
               </h2>

                <h3>At just 16 years old Parker took the reins of the Schnabel family mine at Big Nugget, and showed he had the mettle to lead a team of grizzled miners twice his age, and the ability to find serious gold.
                
                Instead of going to college in season 4, Parker used his college fund to set-up his own mining operation, and found an impressive 1029 oz of gold in his rookie season in the Klondike. Last season Parker came out on top in a competition with Todd by pulling a staggering 3362 ounces of gold worth almost 3.7 million dollars out of his Scribner claims.
                
                This year Parkers back at Scribner after gold but for the first time in his career he's going to be mining without the support and advice of his Grandpa John who sadly passed away in March at the age of 96.

                    <div class="gallery-user-description">Tony Beets is as legendary in the Klondike for his gold finding skills as he is for his colorful language. Before Tony came to Dawson City in 1984, he made ends meet by milking cows, then working in pipeline construction. Tony is a hard-nosed businessman who now runs an enormous gold mine near Dawson City called Paradise Hill. In the off-season Tony and his family live in Arizona.
                    </div>
                    <div class="gallery-user-details">Tony first featured in season two, where he advised greenhorn Todd Hoffman that the secret to successful gold mining was to drill test holes. Tony reappeared in season four leasing land to Parker Schnabel, who he mentored through his rookie season of gold mining in the Klondike. A force to be reckoned with, after pulling in 737oz with his dredge last season Tony is firing on all cylinders. Not only is he planning to pull in serious gold with his dredge, he's gone and bought another one. This season Tony is going to have to juggle his mining operations, ensuring Paradise Hill and his dredge are running smoothly all while shipping his latest purchase, a second huge dredge, 100 miles along the Yukon river.

                    <div class="gallery-user-description">Twenty-five years ago, Jack Hoffman mined for gold in Alaska and came close to losing everything. He failed at realizing his gold mining dream, and was never able to shake the experience and the feeling of letting down his family. In 2010, with his son Todd leading the way, Jack had a second chance to achieve his dream. Since then Jack has seen the Hoffman crew pull in over 5000 ounces of gold and he's still chasing more.
                    </div>
                    <div class="gallery-user-details">71 year old Jack may spend more time in the gold room and not work round the clock shifts that he used to but he's lost none of his work ethic and is still constantly driven by his desire to find gold. By his own admission, he'll do whatever it takes -- even if it ends up killing him. A self-made man who served in the military and is active in his local church, Jack prefers to go on instinct and gut feeling when mining, rather than waste time talking about plans and strategies.

                    <div class="gallery-user-description">Minnie grew up in a small village in Holland with a population of 400. She was one of five children and her parents ran a bakery. When she was six years old, a new family moved in next door, which included a cheeky seven-year-old boy named Tony Beets. Tony and Minnie started dating when she was 20 years old and they married a few years later. Following Tony to Canada, Minnie worked in home healthcare, retail, and in a Dawson hamburger joint (which she later bought and managed).
                    </div>
                    <div class="gallery-user-details">Now, Minnie has been the bookkeeper at Paradise Hill for more than ten years. She controls the purse strings tightly, and frequently argues with Tony over the fortune he is pouring into the dredge. She is the only person Tony can't say 'no' to. The Beets family all operate heavy machinery for the mining business, but Minnie shudders at the thought of it herself: "If he knows I can do it, I'll never be able to get out of it."

I'll come and get you in an hour." Luckily, Monica got the hang of it quickly; moving scoops of tailings all over the family mine.
                    </div>
                    <div class="gallery-user-details">By age 16, Monica was working full time with her dad's mining operation, and was appointed Supervisor at Paradise Hill at just 18. Monica enjoyed the thrill of bossing around men twice her age. "They'd look at you and think, 'What do you know, you're just a girl?' But the fact is, I did know a lot. And with Tony Beets to back me up, they knew they had to do as I said!". Her plans ultimately are to enjoy some well deserved travel before working towards obtaining a qualification as a primary care paramedic.

                    <div class="gallery-user-description">Born in 1920, John was the son of a Kansas wheat farmer. His father brewed bootleg alcohol during prohibition and the family had to leave the farm when the US Marshals came looking for him. At 19 years old, John packed up his possessions and took a steamer north to Haines, Alaska, where he joined his father, who had set up a sawmill.
                    </div>
                    <div class="gallery-user-details">The day after Pearl Harbour was bombed, John volunteered to join the US Navy, but was placed in the Air Corps. After the war he returned to Haines and in 1946, he bought Porcupine Mill, which, after he renovated it, could produce 10,000 feet of board wood per day. John went on to open a local hardware store and was later elected mayor of Haines. At 68, John suffered heart problems and underwent a triple bypass. His doctor recommended that he keep active so John bought the Big Nugget mine and started gold mining. He taught his grandsons Payson and Parker how to prospect, pan and operate equipment and passed on to them his passion for gold mining. On March 18, 2016, John passed away peacefully in his sleep at the age of 96. A statement from the Schnabel family: "We couldn't have asked for a better father, grandfather and overall family man. He was a true legend and we appreciate all of your love and support as we celebrate his wonderful life." Our thoughts go out to the Schnabel family. We'll miss you, Grandpa.

                    <div class="gallery-user-description">Hailing from Juneau Alaska, Gene Cheeseman is an expert contractor who has built roads and buildings across Alaska. Originally sent by Roger Schnabel to help Parker, Gene's mechanical expertise and knowledge of overseeing large operations proved to be key to their success at Scribner.
                    </div>
                    <div class="gallery-user-details">Gene has never been afraid of hard work. Eager to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather and uncle, he ran his first piece of heavy machinery, pushing snow in a D6 dozer, at age 6. He learned his strict work ethic from family and believes that leaders should never ask their crew to do anything they would not do themselves. Gene likes variety in his work and is attracted to difficult jobs with the opportunity for problem solving. One of Gene's most challenging jobs was expanding a historic mountain mining road in Alaska with the daily use of explosives and heavy equipment along the mountain cliff's edge. This was among the most exciting but logistically dangerous jobs Gene has ever done. He later admitted that it was also one of the scariest jobs he's ever done.

                    <div class="gallery-user-description">Working in the family's tree nursery for 22 years, Andy is no stranger to working long hours outdoors and running a variety of heavy equipment. Being raised in a Christian home he was taught the value of honesty and hard work from a young age - his sheer determination means he can work long hours with very little sleep - an amazing feat for a miner but one that can sometimes put himself at risk.
                    </div>
                    <div class="gallery-user-details">Andy believes Gold Rush is an "awesome, life changing, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" and joined Hoffman team in Series 3, hoping to find an alternative income to support his wife and their two children. Andy believes, "Men should be real men, should quit making excuses, and should stand by their commitments to their wife and children and work hard to provide for them financially." After a disastrous season in the jungle in season four, Andy returned to work in the tree nursery buisness but was persuaded to return to the Klondike for one last try. Since then he's found more success with the Hoffman's helping them to pull in over 4000oz of gold. This season Andy's joining the rest of the Hoffman crew in Oregon for the chance to pull in big gold on their home turf.

In 2010, he was a carpenter asked to build a cabin for Greg Remsburg and his family, (who was originally part of Todd Hoffman's first mining crew.) The job was meant to take ten days, but Chris ended up staying with Todd's crew for five months and learnt how to gold mine by trial and error.

                    <div class="gallery-user-details">Chris says panning for gold gives him a thrill, "like opening a Christmas present." As one of the hardest workers on the team he credits his legendary work ethic to growing up on a farm. Chris remembers learning to drive a tractor before he was even tall enough to see through the windshield, "Being a farm boy, you don't have working hours. You do the job for as long as it takes until it's done." Chris worked for 25 years as a plant carpenter and, more recently, he and his wife have been buying, fixing up and selling homes. In his spare time he is a competitive rifle shooter. He also teaches responsible gun use to young people. He has been married to his wife Sharon for 40 years, together the couple have two children.

He's spent most of his life hunting deer, elk and fishing but is also a pretty good skateboarder. Last year, Logan decided to go gold mining as he wanting a bit of adventure before embarking upon a career in accounting.
                    </div>
                    <div class="gallery-user-details">Since joining Hoffman mining crew in Season 3, Logan quickly became a proficient rock truck driver and was always keen to learn more about gold mining. He admits that someday he would love to own his own mining operation. A man never afraid to speak his mind when pushed and he didn't always agree with his Cousin Todd while in the jungle. After their disastrous season in the Guyana Logan returned to Oregon focused on the next stage of his life. It wasn't easy walking away from Todd's as he's family but Logan wanted to get back into education. After Todd found new ground and started getting gold Logan was convinced to return to the Hoffman crew in season 5 and was an integral part of their 1349oz resurrection. Now a five-year veteran of the Hoffman crew, this season Logan's following his family to their native Oregon where he's hoping the new claims can provide him the money he needs to pay off his new mortgage on his first ever home.

He formed a band called the .357 Stringband. Over the last seven years they have released three albums. The band has toured relentlessly around the world and it was during a stop at the Southeast Alaskan State Fair where Rick met Parker Schnabel and expressed an interest in working with him. Nine months later Parker made the call.
                    </div>
                    <div class="gallery-user-details">Rick had no mining experience before joining Gold Rush in Season Three, but he had learned about heavy machines from his early work at his family's commercial construction company. While working for Parker, Rick quickly proved himself a capable excavator and rock truck operator and has gone on to be a confident operator in a loader, dozer, and grader as well. Rick loves to continually seek out adventure and new experiences. In his free time, he loves motorcycles, building his tattoo collection and hitting the gym. Rick stuck by Parker at the end of season 5 despite a difficult ending and played a huge part in holding the crew together, an achievement that played a big part in his promotion to foreman last year. As Parker's foreman Rick lead the crew through a challenging sixth season to bring in their highest ever gold total and this year he's hoping they can do even better.

Feeling depressed and not caring whether He lived or died, Kevin turned to Jesus and not until then, his life started to change for the better. Kevin prayed for a major change in his life and shortly after, Todd Hoffman reached out to Kevin and offered him a position on his team, which he accepted. This was going to be a whole new experience since he knew nothing about gold mining.

Kevin felt his like his mining days were behind him, until he was convinced to return to help mine McKinnon Creek in season 5. It turned out to be the right decision with McKinnon paying out more gold last season than ever before. Kevin's marriage is now stronger than it has ever been. His family is now number one in his life and this season, he's expecting another baby. He's relying on Todd to provide the gold so he can support his family.
